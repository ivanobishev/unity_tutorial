Click on "Get Started" -> Student and hobbyist -> Personal -> Download.
Now we have Unity Hub.

Unity Hub layout:
- Projects.
- Installs: our Unity versions, if we start a project with a version, it is better to...

- Learn: tutorials.
- Community: forums where likely your doubts have already been solved by somebody else.

We click on Projects to create a new one.
It's better to start with 3D.
