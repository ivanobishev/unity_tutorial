- Prefab: is like a template from which we can take instances.
In Assets we create a folder called Prefabs.
We drag our Cube from the the Panel Hierarchy, the Cube has a blue icon,
the blue icon means it is a prefab.
Dragging the prefab to the Scene lets us instantiate the object.
On the right in the Inspector, we can click on Open to change the prefab.
It is recommended to use prefabs when something is used a lot.
You can modify a single clone and it doesn't affect the others.

- Tags: way of identifying a GameObject.
A bunch of enemies would share a Tag.

- Layer: used for grouping GameObjects.
We can apply an effect only to objects that belong to a Layer.
