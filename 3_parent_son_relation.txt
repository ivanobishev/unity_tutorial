Let's create a Sphere, drag it in the panel to the Cube.
If we move the Cube, the Sphere moves with it.

We can create an empty GameObject called Environment,
whose location must be 0,0,0.
This empty GameObject only has one component: Transform,
that specifies the position, rotation and scale.

In the Assets folder create another folder called Materials.
Create a Material, assign it a colour and drag it to the Cube.
